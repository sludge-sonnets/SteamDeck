  - some good info but also a lot of fluff
  - some recommendations are questionable and clearly untested in a Deck environment
- [popsulfr/steam-deck-tricks](https://gitlab.com/popsulfr/steam-deck-tricks)
  - more hardcore, technical tricks
- Fan noise comparison
  - all Decks have fairly loud airflow whooshing when fan is at/near max, but some Decks have a mechanical whine on top of that
  - [example of a "good" fan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEY_FsvwBlo) (turn up volume to hear)
  - [example of a "bad" fan with whine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s51a2kQJH0Y)
  - some people have "fixed" the whiny fan [with additional electrical tape](https://www.theverge.com/23047412/valve-steam-deck-fan-tape-fix-noise-whine) to apply pressure to the fan casing. Not recommended for people inexperienced with taking apart electronic devices.
